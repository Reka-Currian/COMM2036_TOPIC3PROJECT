                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Disinformation is widely defined as the <strong>purposeful</strong> dissemination of false information <strong>intended to mislead or harm</strong>, which largely coincides with the other definitions of disinformation.</p>
                <br><br><br>
                <h2>Why disinformation Spread online?</h2>
                <p>While disinformation is a complex societal issue that did not start with online platforms like Meta (Facebook) or TikTok, it is the business models of these platforms that has led to the development and deployment of technical architecture and algorithms operating with the scale and power to shape public discourse en masse. That discourse is shaped to maximize profits.
                   <br><br>Here is how it works. To generate profits, online platforms must drive and constantly increase engagement on their sites. To do so, they use opaque, automated decision-making to curate the content you see online. The end result is personalized news feeds or search results and targeted ads. This personalisation relies on intrusive tracking of your behaviors online. In other words, the platforms harvest your personal data and track what you do online to deliver “engaging” content, including sensational content and disinformation. The platforms both amplify this often divisive and harmful content and enable its targeting and weaponisation against the users.

                <h2>Case</h2>
                <h3>Disinformations surge threatens to fuel Israel-Hamas conflict</h3>
                <img src="image/disinfo_case.png" align="right" width="50%" height="15%">
                <p>Reuters fact-checking unit has identified numerous cases of social media posts using fake images and information about the Israel-Hamas conflict, and others in which confusion rather than deliberate disinformation appears to have heightened tensions.
                    <br><br>These include:
                    <br>a footage from set of Palestinian film being repurposed to make false claims is far from one-off</p>
                <br><br><br><br>
                <p>In fact, the clip is a behind-the-scenes shot from a Palestinian short film, Empty Place, which focuses on the vacuum left by Palestinians who fled due to the Israeli occupation. It seems to have originated on TikTok before finding its way to X – but while the original TikTok post now appears to be unavailable, on X it has continued to circulate and gain traction.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h2>Statistics about Disinformation</h2>
                    <p>Across all 16 countries, 68% of internet users told us that social media is the place where disinformation is most widespread, far ahead of groups on online messaging apps (38%) and media websites/apps (20%).
                        <br><br>This sentiment is overwhelmingly prevalent in all countries, age groups, social backgrounds, and political preferences. This is even more important as citizens feel that the issue of disinformation is a real threat: 85% express concern about the impact and influence of disinformation on their fellow citizens, a figure that reaches 88% in countries with high levels of HDI and 90% in those with medium/low HDI. They are even more inclined (87%) to believe that this phenomenon has already had a major impact on the political life in their country.
                        <br><br>Moreover, the same percentage (87%) is worried about the impact of disinformation on the upcoming elections in their country with 47% being "very concerned" (this figure reaches 63% among those who describe themselves as "very interested" in politics).
