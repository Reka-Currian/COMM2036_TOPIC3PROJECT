                <h2>Case</h2>
                <h3>CGTN apologizes for Premature Report of Scientist's Death</h3>
                <p>During the G20 summit in Hamburg on July 7-8, 2017, various rumors spread rapidly on social media, particularly Twitter. Among these, five specific rumors garnered significant attention: 1) police using army tanks against protesters, 2) a police officer being permanently blinded by a firecracker, 3) a police raid on the left-wing venue Rote Flora, 4) police using nuclear weapons to deter protesters, and 5) protesters attacking a hospital and emergency room. These rumors were part of the 736,577 tweets collected between July 5-10, 2017, which included 168,799 original tweets and numerous retweets, comments, and likes.
                    <br><br>
                    These rumors were promptly debunked by credible sources while the G20 summit was still ongoing. The Hamburg Police Department and the fact-checking unit of Tagesschau, Germany's most trusted news broadcast, played key roles in countering this misinformation. Tagesschau, known for its objectivity and funded by German citizens, along with the police department, used Twitter to disseminate accurate information and correct the false narratives being spread about the events at the summit.</p>
